# contrail-charms
Juju charms for Contrail services.

# Overview
Contrail 4.0 would provide support for Docker containers. The existing contrail components, which run as services on a BMS or VM, would be running within a Docker container in contrail 4.0.
This document describes how to deploy contrail 4.0 Docker containers, which would be running the several contrail service components using contrail-charms

[Contrail-charms specs](specs/contrail-charms.md)

# Usage

To deploy as a bundle:

1. Create or modify the Juju deployment bundle yaml file to point to machines in which the contrail-charms should be deployed and to include options you need.
2. Specify the contrail docker container image that you want to deployed using charms in the bundle yaml file
3. Deploy the bundle using the command 'juju deploy <bundle_yaml_file>'.
