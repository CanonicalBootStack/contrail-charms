Overview
--------

OpenContrail (www.opencontrail.org) is a fully featured Software Defined
Networking (SDN) solution for private clouds. It supports high performance
isolated tenant networks without requiring external hardware support. It
provides a Neutron plugin to integrate with OpenStack.

This charm provides the Contrail Controller role that includes
configuration API server, control API server, WebUI and required third-party
components.

Only OpenStack Mitaka or newer is supported.
Only for Contrail 4.0 for now.
Juju 2.0 is required.

Usage
-----

Contrail Analytics is prerequisite service to deploy.
Once ready, deploy and relate as follows:

    juju deploy contrail-controller
    juju add-relation contrail-analytics contrail-controller

Resource
--------

The charm requires docker image with Contrail Controller as a resource.
It can be provided as usual for Juju 2.0 in deploy command or
through attach-resource:

    juju attach contrail-controller contrail-controller="$PATH_TO_IMAGE"

External Docker repository
--------------------------

Istead of attaching resource with docker image charm can accept image from remote docker repository.
docker-registry should be specified if the registry is only accessible via http protocol (insecure registry).
docker-user / docker-password can be specified if registry requires authentification.
And image-name / image-tag are the parameters for the image itself.

High Availability (HA)
----------------------

Multiple units of this charm can be deployed to support HA deployments:

    juju add-unit contrail-controller

Relating to haproxy charm (http-services relation) allows multiple units to be
load balanced:

    juju add-relation contrail-controller:http-services haproxy
    juju add-relation contrail-controller:https-services haproxy

The charm can tell to haproxy list of backends via two relations: http-services and https-services.
It tells unsecured backend (like contrail-api:8082 and webUI:8080) via http-services
and secured (like webUI:8143) via https-services.
Such option allows to relate this charm to different haproxy applications
where first haproxy app has ssl_cert/ssl_key in configuration and makes SSL termination itself
but second doesn't have SSL parameters and acts as a proxy/load-balancer.

SSL
---

This charm supports relation to easyrsa charm to obtain certificates for XMPP and Sandesh connections:

    juju add-relation contrail-controller easyrsa
    juju add-relation contrail-agent easyrsa

This mode supports only deployment where analitics and analiticsdb containers deployed
on the same machines as controller container.

External RabbitMQ
-----------------

Charm can be related to RabbitMQ:

    juju add-relation contrail-controller rabbitmq-server:amqp

In this case internal RabbitMQ server will not be run and Contrail software will be configured
to use external one.

List of options
---------------

Option   | Type| default | Description
---------|-----|---------|-------------
control-network | string | | The IP address and netmask of the control network (e.g. 192.168.0.0/24). This network will be used for Contrail endpoints. If not specified, default network will be used.
auth-mode | string | rbac | It represents 'aaa_mode' configuration key of Contrail. Can be one of: 'rbac', 'cloud-admin' or 'no-auth' Authentication mode. Detailed information can be found in the [Contrail documentation](https://github.com/Juniper/contrail-controller/wiki/RBAC) In case of 'rbac' charm will configure Contrail to RBAC mode and administrator must configure RBAC rules to allow users to work. In case of 'cloud-admin' charm will configure Contrail in compatible mode.
cassandra-minimum-diskgb | string | 20 | Contrail has this as parameter and checks it at startup. If disk is smaller then status of DB is not good.
auth-mode | string | rbac | It represents 'aaa_mode' configuration key of Contrail. Can be one of: 'rbac', 'cloud-admin' or 'no-auth' Authentication mode. Detailed information can be found in the Contrail documentation. https://github.com/Juniper/contrail-controller/wiki/RBAC In case of 'rbac' charm will configure Contrail to RBAC mode and administrator must configure RBAC rules to allow users to work. In case of 'cloud-admin' charm will configure Contrail in compatible mode.
cassandra-jvm-extra-opts | string | | Memory limits for Java process of Cassandra.
cloud-admin-role | string | admin | Role name in keystone for users that have full access to everything.
global-read-only-role | string | | Role name in keystone for users that have read-only access to everything.
vip | string | | Contrail API VIP to be used for configuring client-side software like neutron plugin. (to be set up also in KeepAlived charm configuration if itâ€™s used for HA) Private IP of the first Contrail API unit will be used if not set.
use-external-rabbitmq | boolean | false | Charm will wait for external AMQP relation if set. Charm will use internal RabbitMQ server if not set. **NOTE: Changing this flag after deployment is dangerous!**
flow-export-rate | string | 0 | Defines how much flow records will be exported by vRouter agent to the Contrail Collector when a flow is created or deleted.
docker-registry | string | | URL of docker-registry. Should be passed only if registry is not secured and must be added to docker config to allow work with it.
