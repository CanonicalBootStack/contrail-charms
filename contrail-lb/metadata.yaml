summary: Contrail TSN Service Node and Tor Agent
maintainer: Sivakumar Gurumurthy <sgurumurthy@juniper.net>
description: |
  The TOR services node (TSN) acts as the multicast controller for the ToR
  switches. The TSN also provides DHCP and DNS services to the bare metal
  servers or virtual instances running behind ToR switch ports.
  The TSN receives all the broadcast packets from the ToR switch, and replicates
  them to the required compute nodes in the cluster and to other EVPN nodes.
  Broadcast packets from the virtual machines in the cluster are sent directly
  from the respective compute nodes to the ToR switch.
  A ToR agent provisioned in the Contrail cluster acts as the OVSDB client for
  the ToR switch, and all of the OVSDB interactions with the ToR switch are
  performed by using the ToR agent.
  The TOR agent programs the different OVSDB tables onto the ToR switch and
  receives the local unicast table entries from the ToR switch.
  The typical practice is to run the ToR agent on the TSN node.
  
  This charm provides both the TSN and TOR agent service on the same node.
  It supports running multiple TOR agents as well.
